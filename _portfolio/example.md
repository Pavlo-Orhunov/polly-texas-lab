* Image quality refers to how accurately an image reproduces the original scene or intent. High-quality images are clear, sharp, and free from distortions or artifacts. Various factors influence image quality, including resolution, compression, and color accuracy.
* The assessment of image quality can be objective, using algorithms and metrics, or subjective, relying on human judgment. Both approaches are essential in creating images that meet the desired visual standards.
